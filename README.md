## Introduction

The Book Store is a Mobile first ReactJS-based web application that simulates a real-world bookstore. This project is a training task, highlighting the integration of various web technologies.

## Technologies

This project utilizes ReactJS for building the user interface, coupled with Redux for managing the state of the product list and shopping cart, ensuring data persistence across page reloads. Fluent UI is used for few UI components, and SASS aids in writing more efficient and maintainable stylesheets. The application is structured as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router for seamless page navigation.
